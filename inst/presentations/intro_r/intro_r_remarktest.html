- R is 'GNU S', a libre (free) software environment for statistical computing under
the Free Software Foudation's GNU General Public Liscense.
- R is a dynamic, lexically scoped, functional, class based object oriented
programming (OOP) language written for statistical computation often written by
statisticians.
- Through its base set of packages and extensive number of packages, you can
conduct nearly any statistical analyses with ease.
- S is a statistical programming language developed by John Chambers, Rick
  Becker, and Alan Wilks at Bell Labs. It's first implementation was in 1976.
- S was superceded by S-PLUS, commercial software owned by TIBCO.
- R is an implementation of S with lexical scoping.
- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University at Aukland,
New Zealand.
- It's inception was in 1992, it's initial version was released in 1995 and the
first stable version in 2000.

Why use R?
===============

- R is a programming language available, libre, as Free Software under the Free
Software Foudation's GNU General Public Liscense
- Maintained and supported by a large community of statisticians.
- Over 5000 packages on CRAN to extend its base functionality.
- R is written in C, Fortan, and R. It can easily be extended through Java
  and C++.
- With careful coding, R can be quite fast.
- It's easy and fun.

  A simple, in-browser, Markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS, featuring:

- Markdown formatting, with smart extensions

- Presenter mode, with cloned slideshow view

- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages

- Slide scaling, thus similar appearance on all devices / resolutions .red[*]

- Touch support for smart phones and pads, i.e. swipe to navigate slides

.footnote[.red[*] At least browsers try their best]

If your ideal slideshow creation workflow contains any of the following steps:

- Just write what's on your mind

- Do some basic styling

- Easily collaborate with others

- Share with and show to everyone

Then remark might be perfect for your next.red[*] slideshow!

.footnote[.red[*] You probably want to convert existing slideshows as well]

.right-column[
As the slideshow is expressed using Markdown, you may:

- Focus on the content, expressing yourself in next to plain text not worrying what flashy graphics and disturbing effects to put where

As the slideshow is actually an HTML document, you may:

- Display it in any decent browser

- Style it using regular CSS, just like any other HTML content

- Use it offline!

As the slideshow is contained in a plain file, you may:

- Store it wherever you like; on your computer, hosted from your Dropbox, hosted on Github Pages alongside the stuff you're presenting...

- Easily collaborate with others, keeping track of changes using your favourite SCM tool, like Git or Mercurial

  ## How does it work?
### - Markdown
]
.right-column[
A Markdown-formatted chunk of text is transformed into individual slides by JavaScript running in the browser:

```remark
# Slide 1
This is slide 1

---

# Slide 2
This is slide 2
```

.slides[
  .first[
  ### Slide 1
  This is slide 1
  ]
  .second[
  ### Slide 2
  This is slide 2
  ]
]

Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception:

  - A line containing three dashes constitutes a new slide
  (not a horizontal rule, `&amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;`)

Have a look at the [Markdown website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you're not familiar with Markdown formatting.

  ## How does it work?
  ### - Markdown
  ### - Inside HTML
]
.right-column[
A simple HTML document is needed for hosting the styles, Markdown and the generated slides themselves:

```xml
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
      /* Slideshow styles */
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
*    &lt;textarea id="source"&gt;
      &lt;!-- Slideshow Markdown --&gt;
    &amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;
*    &lt;script src="remark.js"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
*      var slideshow = remark.create();
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

You may download remark to have your slideshow not depend on any online resources, or reference the [latest version](http://remarkjs.com/downloads/remark-latest.min.js) online directly.

  ## Markdown extensions
]
.right-column[
To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few Markdown extensions have been included:

- Slide properties, for naming, styling and templating slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages
]

.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
]
.right-column[
Initial lines containing key-value pairs are extracted as slide properties:

```remark
name: agenda
class: middle, center

# Agenda

The name of this slide is {{ name }}.
```

Slide properties serve multiple purposes:

* Naming and styling slides using properties `name` and `class`

* Using slides as templates using properties `template` and `layout`

* Expansion of `{{ property }}` expressions to property values

See the [complete list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#slide-properties) of slide properties.

]
.right-column[
Any occurences of one or more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

```remark
.footnote[.red.bold[*] Important footnote]
```

Resulting HTML extract:

```xml
&lt;span class="footnote"&gt;
  &lt;span class="red bold"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Important footnote
&lt;/span&gt;
```
